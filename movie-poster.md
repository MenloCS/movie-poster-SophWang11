At each step, save and commit your work in GitHub Desktop.

## Using GitHub Desktop (Mac)

1. **Edit** this file (`movie-poster-project.md`) in TextEdit.  
2. **Save** your changes.  
3. Open **GitHub Desktop**.  
   - Check that `movie-poster-project.md` shows up under **Changes**.  
   - Write a commit summary (see below).  
   - Click **Commit to main**.  
4. Click **Push origin** (top bar) to upload to GitHub.com.  

**Commit Messages for Each Step**
- Step 1: *Completed creative brief*  
- Step 2: *Documented first two AI attempts*  
- Step 3: *Documented final AI attempts*

# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title: How to Train Your Dragon**  
- **Why I chose this movie: I love dragons **  

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion: excitement **  

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element: a dragon flying**  
- **Why this element: Its a key part of this world and what the movie is about**  

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid: village landscapes that are too detailed, the background should be simple**  

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s): green, black, blue **  
- **Accent color(s): purple, red, brown/gray**  
- **Overall mood: warm ** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright)  

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [ yes] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ yes] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description: focus on a rider and their dragon in the center of the scene, flying backwards**

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1: **  
- **My prompt: generate a How to Train Your Dragon Poster with Hiccup riding toothless while flying away from a bright background with people holding torches**  

- **What worked: The characters were relatively accurate**  
- **What didn't work: Too many people in the background, the characters looked a little wonky**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: i want the background to be green with hills and not that many people in the background holding torches and their figures shouldn't be seen only their shadow with torches**  

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt: generate a How to Train Your Dragon Poster with Hiccup riding toothless while flying away from a bright background with people holding torches i want hiccup to be big and i want the background to be green with hills and not that many people in the background holding torches and their figures shouldn't be seen only their shadow with torches**  

- **What worked: characters and background look pretty good**  
- **What didn't work: The background is too green**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: different colors in the sky**

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:generate a How to Train Your Dragon Poster with Hiccup riding toothless while flying away from a bright background with people holding torches i want hiccup to be big and i want the background to be green with hills and not that many people in the background holding torches and their figures shouldn't be seen only their shadow with torches i want the sky to be blue/orangeish**  

- **What worked: nice sky**  
- **What didn't work: wider image, less movie-like**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: smaller toothless**  

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:generate a How to Train Your Dragon Poster with Hiccup riding toothless while flying away from a bright background with people holding torches i want hiccup to be big and i want the background to be green with hills and not that many people in the background holding torches and their figures shouldn't be seen only their shadow with torches i want the sky to be blue/orangeish i want hiccup and toothless to be higher in the air**  

- **What worked: nice background**  
- **What didn't work: too empty of a background**

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
